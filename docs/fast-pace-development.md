  - Base URL: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1

## Goal
Reach the first end‑to‑end movie generation as fast as possible. We implement only the minimum set of agents strictly required to output a short video (MP4) from a high‑level idea, accepting quality trade‑offs (reduced polish, simplified visuals/audio, minimal QC).

## Principles
- Implement only critical‑path agents; defer everything that mainly improves quality.
- Prefer simple prompts and defaults; avoid complex cross‑agent coordination at v0.
- Produce a single short clip (e.g., 10–30s) as the first milestone.

## Minimal Agent Order (Strict MVP Sequence)
Derived from AI_AGENT_SYSTEM.md → Primary Production Pipeline. Each item shows: Agent (MCP) — Purpose — Status — Key input/output.

### ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL - All Story Services LIVE
1) **Series Creator** (Story MCP) — Seed concept — ✅ **LIVE** at story.ft.tc — input: user idea; output: concept brief
2) **Story Architect** (Story Architect MCP) — Story arc — ✅ **LIVE** (Sept 30, 2025) — input: concept; output: high‑level arc with OpenRouter LLM
3) **Episode Breakdown** (Story MCP) — Beats/scenes — ✅ **LIVE** — input: arc; output: scene list with 1–3 key beats
4) **Story Bible** (Story Bible MCP) — Story continuity — ✅ **LIVE** (Sept 30, 2025) at port 8015 — input: story elements; output: continuity tracking with OpenRouter LLM

### ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL - Character MCP (Port 8011) is LIVE at https://character.ft.tc
5) **Character Creator** (Character MCP) — Core characters — ✅ **LIVE & VERIFIED** — input: arc + beats; output: minimal character profiles (2–4)

### ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL - Visual MCP (Port 8012) is LIVE at https://visual.ft.tc
6) **Storyboard Artist** (Visual MCP) — Rough boards — ✅ **LIVE & VERIFIED** (Sept 30, 2025) — input: beats + characters; output: 6–12 frame descriptions with camera notes
7) **Image Generation** (Visual MCP) — Key frames — ✅ **LIVE & VERIFIED** (Sept 30, 2025) — input: storyboard frames; output: images per frame (FAL.ai + OpenRouter integration)

### 🎉 MVP CRITICAL PATH: 100% COMPLETE AND VERIFIED FROM FRONTEND!

### 🔄 In Progress / Partially Implemented
8) **Video Generation** (Production) — Short segments — 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** — input: images/frames; output: 7–10s video segments

### ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL - Video Editor MCP (Port 8016) is LIVE at https://video-editor.ft.tc
9) **Video Editor** (Post) — Assembly — ✅ **LIVE** (Sept 30, 2025) — input: segments; output: single MP4 clip with transitions and effects

### ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL - Final QC MCP (Port 8017) is LIVE at https://qc.ft.tc
10) **Final QC** (Post) — Basic checks — ✅ **LIVE** (Sept 30, 2025) — input: MP4; output: pass/fail + quality report (black frames, frozen frames, duration validation)

### 📋 Not Yet Implemented
11) **Distribution** (Post) — Export — 📋 **NEXT PRIORITY** — input: final MP4; output: downloadable/rendered artifact

Notes:
- Audio is optional for MVP. If time allows, add simple background music via “Audio Mixer” later (see Next‑Upgrades). Voice/dialogue is deferred.
- Character Designer can be skipped initially by letting prompts describe visuals inline in the storyboard and image prompts.

## Deferred (Quality‑Only) Agents — Not Required for First Output
These improve quality but are not needed to get a first video. Implement after MVP:
- Dialogue Writer, Voice Creator, Voice Director, Audio Mixer, Music Composer, Foley, Voice Matching
- Character Designer, Concept Artist, Environment Designer, Costume Designer, Props Master, Shot Designer
- Compositor, Color Grader, VFX Supervisor, Continuity, Quality Controller, Subtitle/Caption, Marketing Asset
- Script Supervisor, Location Scout, Research, Legal Compliance, Render Farm Coordinator, Version Control, Performance Monitor, Cost Optimizer

## Minimal MCP Services Needed for MVP
- Story MCP (hosts: Series Creator, Story Architect, Episode Breakdown)
- Story Bible MCP (hosts: Story Bible) — separate domain; all other Story agents remain under Story MCP
- Character MCP (hosts: Character Creator)
- Visual MCP (hosts: Storyboard Artist, Image Generation)
- Video generation step can be a simple utility/integration rather than a full MCP at v0; promote to its own agent/service later.
- Post (Video Editor, Final QC, Distribution) can initially be simple scripts/utilities called by the UI.

## Hand‑offs (I/O Contracts)
- Concept brief → Story arc → Episode beats → Character profiles → Storyboard frames → Images → Video segments → Edited MP4 → QC pass → Distribution
- Keep outputs as plain JSON/Markdown objects so UI can show each stage without extra transformation.

## Next‑Upgrades (Fast Follow)
Add in this order to improve perceived quality without large complexity jumps:
1) Character Designer (Character MCP) — better visual consistency
2) Color Grader (Post) — quick film look and tone consistency
3) Audio Mixer (Audio MCP) — add simple background track
4) Compositor (Post) — basic overlays/transitions
5) Quality Controller (Production Planning) — automated basic checks before Final QC

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED DEPLOYMENT SEQUENCE

### IMMEDIATE (Week 1) - Unblock Story Pipeline
**Deploy Story MCP Service (Port 8010) FIRST**

**Why**: Blocks agents 1-3 (Series Creator, Story Architect, Episode Breakdown). Without this, no story can be created.

**How to Deploy**:
```bash
cd /var/www/movie-generation-platform/services/mcp-story-service
# Setup environment
cp .env.dev.example .env
# Edit .env with production values
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Start with PM2
pm2 start "python -m src.mcp.server" --name mcp-story-service
pm2 save
```

**Verify**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8010/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy"}
```

**Impact**: Enables story creation workflow (steps 1-3 of MVP)

---

### ✅ COMPLETED (September 30, 2025 - 03:00 UTC) - Character Development Enabled
**Character MCP Service (Port 8011) DEPLOYED**

**Status**: ✅ LIVE at https://character.ft.tc

**Deployment Details**:
- Mode: Simplified (uses PayloadCMS as data store)
- No separate database required
- All character data stored in PayloadCMS (MongoDB via auto-movie)
- SSL: Let's Encrypt (auto-renews)
- PM2: Configured and running
- Nginx: Reverse proxy configured

**Verify**:
```bash
curl https://character.ft.tc/health
# Returns: {"status":"healthy","service":"mcp-character-service","mode":"simplified"}
```

**Impact**: ✅ Character creation workflow (step 5 of MVP) is now ENABLED

---

### ✅ COMPLETED (September 30, 2025 - 03:35 UTC) - All Story Services Deployed
**Story Architect MCP & Story Bible MCP Services DEPLOYED**

**Status**: 
- ✅ mcp-story-architect-service LIVE (PM2)
- ✅ mcp-story-bible-service LIVE (PM2, port 8015)

**Deployment Details**:
- OpenRouter LLM integration configured on all services
- Production `.env` files created from `.env.prod.example`
- Proper `.gitignore` files added to all services
- PM2 configuration saved for automatic restart
- All services using:
  - Default Model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5
  - Backup Model: qwen/qwen3-vl-235b-a22b-thinking
  - Base URL: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1

**Services Configuration**:
```bash
# Story Architect Service
cd /var/www/movie-generation-platform/services/mcp-story-architect-service
pm2 logs mcp-story-architect-service

# Story Bible Service  
cd /var/www/movie-generation-platform/services/mcp-story-bible-service
pm2 logs mcp-story-bible-service
# Running on: http://0.0.0.0:8015

# Story Service (already live)
pm2 logs mcp-story-service
```

**Verify**:
```bash
pm2 list | grep "mcp-story"
# Should show all three services online
```

**Impact**: 
- ✅ Story architecture workflow (step 2 of MVP) is now ENABLED with LLM
- ✅ Story continuity tracking (step 4 of MVP) is now ENABLED with LLM
- ✅ Complete story pipeline operational

---

### 🔴 NEXT PRIORITY - Enable Visual Content
**Deploy Visual Design MCP Service (Port 8012) NEXT**

**Why**: Blocks agents 5-6 (Storyboard Artist, Image Generation). This is the LAST critical service needed for MVP workflow.

**Status**: ⚠️ NOT YET DEPLOYED - **PRIORITY 1**

**How to Deploy**:
```bash
cd /var/www/movie-generation-platform/services/mcp-visual-design-service
cp .env.example .env
pip install -r requirements.txt
pm2 start "python -m src.main" --name mcp-visual-service
pm2 save
```

**Verify**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8012/health
```

**Impact**: Will enable storyboarding and image generation (steps 5-6 of MVP) - COMPLETES CRITICAL PATH

---

### AFTER MVP CORE (Later) - Post-Production
Once steps 1-6 are working, implement:
- Video Generation service (step 7)
- Video Editor service (step 8)
- Final QC service (step 9)
- Distribution service (step 10)
