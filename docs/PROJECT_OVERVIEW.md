## üéØ Core Vision

**"Enable anyone to create professional-quality movies using AI assistance"**

The platform serves as an intelligent production assistant that:
- Guides story development and character creation
- Generates visual concepts and storyboards
- Coordinates production planning and workflows
- Manages assets, scripts, and collaborative editing
- Provides AI-powered recommendations and automation

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Philosophy

**Centralized Brain Service Model**:
