## Agent Dependencies Matrix

### **Critical Path Agents** (Must complete before others can proceed)
1. **Series Creator** → All other agents depend on initial concept
2. **Story Architect** → Episode and character development depends on overall arc  
3. **Character Creator** → Voice, visual, and casting agents need character profiles
4. **Episode Breakdown** → Scene planning and production agents need episode structure

### **Parallel Processing Groups**
- **Character Development**: Character Designer + Voice Creator + Character Arc Manager
- **Visual Design**: Concept Artist + Environment Designer + Costume Designer + Props Master
- **Scene Planning**: Storyboard Artist + Shot Designer + Scene Director + Cinematographer
- **Content Generation**: Image Generation + Video Generation + Animation Director
- **Audio Production**: Voice Director + Sound Designer + Music Composer + Foley Artist

### **Sequential Dependencies**
```
Story Bible Agent → Continuity Agent → Quality Controller Agent → Final QC Agent
Voice Creator → Voice Library Manager → Voice Director → Dialogue Delivery → Voice Matching
Storyboard Artist → Image Generation → Video Generation → Video Editor → Compositor
```

## Scaling Considerations

### **Agent Instances**
- **Single Instance**: Story Bible, Series Creator, Production Manager
- **Multiple Instances**: Video Generation (per episode), Character Designer (per character)
- **Load Balanced**: Image Generation, Voice Generation, Quality Control

### **Resource Allocation**
- **CPU Heavy**: Text-based agents (Story, Dialogue, Script)
- **GPU Heavy**: Image Generation, Video Generation, Animation
- **Memory Heavy**: Voice Library Manager, Asset Manager, Version Control

### **Coordination Complexity**
- **Low**: Individual creative agents working in isolation
- **Medium**: Cross-department coordination (Visual + Audio)
- **High**: Quality control across all departments, final assembly

This system provides comprehensive movie production capabilities with clear agent responsibilities, interaction patterns, and scalable architecture for AI-driven content creation.
