## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Why Did This Happen?

1. **Incomplete Validation**: The `status` field was extracted from form data but not passed to the Zod schema validation, causing validation to fail.

2. **Zod Version Mismatch**: The error handler was written for Zod v3 (using `errors` array) but the project uses Zod v4 (which uses `issues` array).

3. **Hardcoded Values**: The validated status was ignored in favor of a hardcoded value, defeating the purpose of validation.

### Prevention Measures

1. **Add Integration Tests**: Create automated tests for form submission flows
2. **Zod Version Checks**: Add compatibility checks for Zod error handling
3. **Code Review**: Ensure all schema fields are included in validation calls
4. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript to catch missing field mappings
