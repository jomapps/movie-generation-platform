# Clarification Questions

1. What execution environment is available for FFmpeg—are we invoking a local binary, containerized service, or remote API, and how do we manage version consistency across deployments? local binary. dont worry about version consistency.
2. Do we need to support variable input frame rates/resolutions by re-encoding segments, or should mismatches trigger validation errors that halt assembly? No. none of that.
3. Are there predefined naming conventions and storage locations for intermediate downloads and the final MP4 asset to keep alignment with Distribution and QC agents? Name the media with payloadcms, such that you know the project, episodes and scenes.
4. How should the agent handle segments that exceed the target runtime—trim automatically, request new inputs, or fail the job? the job will fail from fal.ai automatically. and if that fails, you report.
5. Should the agent inject silent audio tracks in all outputs by default, or only when the source segments lack audio and the distribution channel requires it? dont bother with this. let it be.
6. What telemetry/metrics are mandatory (e.g., segment duration drift, assembly latency), and where should they be emitted for observability? nothing to be done here.
7. Is there a requirement to support resumable or checkpointed assemblies if FFmpeg fails mid-run, or is a simple retry strategy sufficient for MVP? just report with the error and stop
