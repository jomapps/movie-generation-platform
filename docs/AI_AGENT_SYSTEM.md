### **Coordination Patterns**

#### **Sequential Dependencies**
```
Story Bible → Continuity → Quality Controller → Final QC
Voice Creator → Voice Library Manager → Voice Director → Dialogue Delivery → Voice Matching
Storyboard Artist → Image Generation → Video Generation → Video Editor → Compositor
```

#### **Parallel Processing Groups**
- **Character Development**: Character Designer + Voice Creator + Character Arc Manager
- **Visual Design**: Concept Artist + Environment Designer + Costume Designer + Props Master
- **Content Generation**: Image Generation + Video Generation + Animation Director
- **Audio Production**: Voice Director + Sound Designer + Music Composer + Foley Artist

#### **Critical Path Agents** (Must complete before others can proceed)
1. **Series Creator** → All other agents depend on initial concept
2. **Story Architect** → Episode and character development depends on overall arc
3. **Character Creator** → Voice, visual, and casting agents need character profiles
4. **Episode Breakdown** → Scene planning and production agents need episode structure

## 📊 Resource Allocation

### **Agent Instances**
- **Single Instance**: Story Bible, Series Creator, Production Manager
- **Multiple Instances**: Video Generation (per episode), Character Designer (per character)
- **Load Balanced**: Image Generation, Voice Generation, Quality Control

### **Resource Requirements**
- **CPU Heavy**: Text-based agents (Story, Dialogue, Script)
- **GPU Heavy**: Image Generation, Video Generation, Animation
- **Memory Heavy**: Voice Library Manager, Asset Manager, Version Control

### **Coordination Complexity**
- **Low**: Individual creative agents working in isolation
- **Medium**: Cross-department coordination (Visual + Audio)
- **High**: Quality control across all departments, final assembly

## 🎯 Implementation Status

### **Phase 3 Planning (Q2 2025)**
- **Domain MCP Services**: Story, Character, Visual, Audio, Asset
- **Agent Implementation**: 50+ specialized agents with custom prompts
- **Workflow Coordination**: LangGraph-based multi-agent orchestration
- **Quality Control**: Automated consistency and continuity checking
