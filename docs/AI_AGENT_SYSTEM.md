### **Coordination Patterns**

#### **Sequential Dependencies**
```
Story Bible ‚Üí Continuity ‚Üí Quality Controller ‚Üí Final QC
Voice Creator ‚Üí Voice Library Manager ‚Üí Voice Director ‚Üí Dialogue Delivery ‚Üí Voice Matching
Storyboard Artist ‚Üí Image Generation ‚Üí Video Generation ‚Üí Video Editor ‚Üí Compositor
```

#### **Parallel Processing Groups**

- **Visual Design**: Concept Artist + Environment Designer + Costume Designer + Props Master
- **Content Generation**: Image Generation + Video Generation + Animation Director
- **Audio Production**: Voice Director + Sound Designer + Music Composer + Foley Artist

#### **Critical Path Agents** (Must complete before others can proceed)
1. **Series Creator** ‚Üí All other agents depend on initial concept
2. **Story Architect** ‚Üí Episode and character development depends on overall arc
3. **Character Creator** ‚Üí Voice, visual, and casting agents need character profiles
4. **Episode Breakdown** ‚Üí Scene planning and production agents need episode structure

## üìä Resource Allocation

### **Agent Instances**
- **Single Instance**: Story Bible, Series Creator, Production Manager
- **Multiple Instances**: Video Generation (per episode), Character Designer (per character)
- **Load Balanced**: Image Generation, Voice Generation, Quality Control

### **Resource Requirements**
- **CPU Heavy**: Text-based agents (Story, Dialogue, Script)
- **GPU Heavy**: Image Generation, Video Generation, Animation
- **Memory Heavy**: Voice Library Manager, Asset Manager, Version Control

### **Coordination Complexity**
- **Low**: Individual creative agents working in isolation
- **Medium**: Cross-department coordination (Visual + Audio)
- **High**: Quality control across all departments, final assembly

## üéØ Implementation Status

### **Phase 3 Planning (Q2 2025)**
- **Domain MCP Services**: Story, Character, Visual, Audio, Asset
- **Agent Implementation**: 50+ specialized agents with custom prompts
- **Workflow Coordination**: LangGraph-based multi-agent orchestration
- **Quality Control**: Automated consistency and continuity checking

### **Current Status**
