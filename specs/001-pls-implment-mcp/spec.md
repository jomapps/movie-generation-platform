# Feature Specification: MCP Brain Service ‚Äî Knowledge Graph and Retrieval

**Feature Branch**: `001-pls-implment-mcp`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "pls implment @mcp-brain-service-idea.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something, mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an agent or service interacting via the MCP interface, I can store and
retrieve story knowledge within a specific project, so narrative context stays
coherent and relevant information is surfaced during creative workflows.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a project with characters and recorded relationships, when a user asks
   "Find characters who would conflict in a bar scene", then the system returns
   characters with relevant tension relationships and personality signals that
   explain the conflict.
2. Given a character marked as deceased in a project, when a request attempts to
   apply another "kill" event to that character, then the system rejects the
   request with a clear error indicating a conflict with established facts.
3. Given multiple episodes under the same project, when retrieving a
   character's traits, then the returned traits are consistent across episodes
   unless an explicit change record exists.

### Edge Cases
- Missing project identifier: the system rejects the request with a clear error
  and remediation guidance.
- Concurrent conflicting updates: the system rejects the change or enforces a
  deterministic resolution policy that prevents inconsistent state. [NEEDS
  CLARIFICATION: conflict resolution policy]
- Ambiguous or underspecified query: the system returns actionable
  clarification guidance rather than low-quality results.
- Empty project knowledge base: the system returns a no-results outcome without
  error, including suggestions on how to populate context.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: All requests MUST include a valid project identifier; requests
  without it are rejected with a clear error and remediation guidance.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST isolate data by project; data from one project is
  never visible to or modifiable by another project.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow ingestion of text and images as knowledge
  items associated with a project.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST generate and store semantic representations of
  ingested content to enable similarity-based retrieval.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST maintain a structured graph of entities and
  relationships to support relational queries.
- **FR-006**: Retrieval MUST combine semantic similarity with graph traversal to
  produce results that include entities and their relevant relationships.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST block conflicting updates that violate
  established facts or rules (e.g., attempting to "kill" an already deceased
  character).
- **FR-008**: The system MUST record the identifier/version of the semantic
  representation method used for each stored representation to ensure
  reproducibility of results.
- **FR-009**: Access to knowledge MUST occur exclusively through the MCP
  interface; direct database access is out of scope for this feature.
- **FR-010**: The service MUST operate self-contained with configuration
  provided via environment or settings, without hard dependency on other
  platform services to function.
- **FR-011**: The system SHOULD provide basic observability for operations
  (usage logs and health/metrics) to support monitoring and quality.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST provide clear error messages and remediation
  hints for common failures (missing project identifier, ambiguous query,
  invalid update).

*Unclear areas to confirm:*
- **FR-013**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data retention/deletion policy]
- **FR-014**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: access control and permissions per project]
- **FR-015**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance targets (latency, throughput,
  data scale)]
- **FR-016**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: approach to fact versioning and retroactive
  corrections]
- **FR-017**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: conflict rules catalog beyond example
  cases]
- **FR-018**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: initial entity taxonomy scope]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project**: A story universe context. Key attributes: identifier, name,
  creation timestamps, settings.
- **Knowledge Item**: Content ingested for a project (text or image), with
  provenance and timestamps, plus a semantic representation descriptor
  (identifier/version).
- **Entity**: Concept in the story world (e.g., character, location, artifact,
  scene) with attributes such as name, description, status, and traits.
- **Relationship**: Typed link between entities (e.g., tension, affiliation),
  with strength/notes and optional temporal scope.
- **Query**: A request capturing project identifier, input, and optional
  filters.
- **Result**: Aggregated answer including matched entities, relationships, and
  supporting evidence suitable for user interpretation.
